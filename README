# DISTINGUISHABLE HALO ANALYSIS

## Getting started
1. Configure the analysis by creating a Matlab script using config_090617_1" as an example template
	* turn the correlation analysis flag (+ savedata) off when getting started with a new dataset or experimenting with halo captures
2. Open Matlab and run:
	[halo_k,corr,efit,halo,txy,fout]=run_dist_halo(PATH_TO_CONFIG);
